:three: Clone the GitHub repository locally on your computer

* The repository has one default branch called `main` protected by branch rules which doesn't allow you to commit directly your changes.
 
* After you clone the repository locally, create new branch, preferably named with your GitHub username. On that branch you will upload your exercises.

:four: Each programming language has it's own directory where to submit your files. IF there is not existing directory for the language you are currently practicing, create a new folder in the main directory with the specific programming language name and use it to submit your code.

:five: Inside each programming language folder you will find child folders for each difficulty. The Kata's on Codewars are separated on different difficulty levels from 1(hardest) up to 8(easiest).
