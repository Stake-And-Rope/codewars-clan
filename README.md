:three: Clone the GitHub repository locally on your computer

* The repository has one default branch called `main` protected by branch rules which doesn't allow you to commit directly your changes.
 
* After you clone the repository locally, create new branch, preferably named with your GitHub username. On that branch you will upload your exercises.

:four: Each programming language has it's own directory where to submit your files. IF there is not existing directory for the language you are currently practicing, create a new folder in the main directory with the specific programming language name and use it to submit your code.

:five: Inside each programming language folder you will find child folders for each difficulty. The Kata's on Codewars are separated on different difficulty levels from 1(hardest) up to 8(easiest). Submit your code on the respective difficulty folder for your language. If the folder doesn't exist, you can create it by yourself.
