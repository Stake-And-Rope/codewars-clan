The purpose of this repository is to collect all the submitted Codewars solutions of [Stake-And-Rope](https://github.com/Stake-And-Rope) organization and [@Raccoons](https://github.com/orgs/Stake-And-Rope/teams/raccoons) members.

### But why ❓
* Solving exercises and problems in group
* Help each other learning and gaining new skills
* Keeping all solutions in one place. If anyone else needs additional hints, help or just wants to check another approach.
* We may organize regular group coding sessions where we can solve problems in group

:three: Clone the GitHub repository locally on your computer

* The repository has one default branch called `main` protected by branch rules which doesn't allow you to commit directly your changes.
 
* After you clone the repository locally, create new branch, preferably named with your GitHub username. On that branch you will upload your exercises.

:four: Each programming language has it's own directory where to submit your files. IF there is not existing directory for the language you are currently practicing, create a new folder in the main directory with the specific programming language name and use it to submit your code.

:five: Inside each programming language folder you will find child folders for each difficulty. The Kata's on Codewars are separated on different difficulty levels from 1(hardest) up to 8(easiest). Submit your code on the respective difficulty folder for your language. If the folder doesn't exist, you can create it by yourself.

:six: Create/Upload the new file containing the solution of Kata. One the top of your file add multi-line comments:

* `Kata's URL address` - the URL address of the Kata
* `Difficulty` - The exact difficulty of the Kata
